To keep your Telegram bot token secure, avoid hardcoding it in your scripts. Here is how you can do it :

Put .env file at root of project 

### Linux/macOS: Add this line to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
```export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your-secret-token"```
### Windows (PowerShell):
```$env:TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your-secret-token"```

### in config.py
```
import os
TOKEN = os.getenv("TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN")
```

Keep your .env file private to protect sensitive data.

Consider using a separate wallet for bot transactions to minimize risk.
